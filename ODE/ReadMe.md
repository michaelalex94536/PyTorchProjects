"Torch_RLC" is a Jupyter notebook that solves for the current in a series RLC circuit.  The capacitor is initially charged to some voltage V, a switch closes at t = 0, and we calculate the current flow in the circuit as a function of time as the capacitor discharges.  The user can elect to solve for the under-, critically-, and over-damped cases, depending on the value of R selected. 

This is an example of a PINN - a physics informed neural network.
